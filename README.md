# robot-template

A template for quickly creating automated mouse clicks and keypresses (using java.awt.Robot).

## Pre-requisites

Because I don't have the patience to publish stuff to mavenCentral, you need to build one dependency locally before you
can build this project.

```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/yngvark/robothelper-lib
./gradlew publish
```

## Run

```bash
make run
```
